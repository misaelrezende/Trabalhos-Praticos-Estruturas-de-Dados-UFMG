# Computer-Vision-Project
Code from our project in Computer Vision discipline.

## Purpose
Chrono Cross is a video game originally released in 1999 that recently received a new version in modern game console systems. As the game had poor evaluations of its remastered visuals, this work proposes to evaluate the application of common super-resolution solutions to its videos. Our methods include applying bilinear and bicubic filters as well as the learning-based ESPCN and evaluating the changes through the PSNR and SSIM metrics.

## Dependencies
The dependencies to run our project are in the `project_environment.yml` file.
